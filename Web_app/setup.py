# packages tells Python what package directories (and the Python files they contain) to include.
# find_packages() finds these directories automatically so you donâ€™t have to type them out.
# To include other files, such as the static and templates directories, include_package_data is set.
# Python needs another file named MANIFEST.in to tell what this other data is.
